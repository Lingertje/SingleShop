# KPN Single Shop

Thank you for taking a look at my implementation of the KPN Single Shop assignment.
This assigment was my first time working with Nuxt and I really enjoyed it. My experience with Next.js made it easier to get started with Nuxt.
I worked on creating a product overview page based on the products.json file provided with the assignment. With the most time being spent on the implementation of the product filters.
The CSS is mobile first and I tried to make it as responsive as possible. I also added some basic unit tests to the project.

This project contains 1 API route `/api/products` which returns the products.json file.

This project is build with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/).
